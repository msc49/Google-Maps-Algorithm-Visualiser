- This file is just meant to be used as a guide for myself to plan this project
- it will be left in my repository just in case others wanted to have a look as it :)

before even trying to implement the algorithm, we need a grid:
- This can be made using HTML/CSS or Pygame. To learn a new library and for a better user experience, i will use the latter

The grid dimensions are irrelevant for now. The grid must be able to:
- Create a starting node
- Create an ending node
- (we will also add walls where the algorithm is not allowed to touch. These will also be nodes but for now we ignore this)

BREAKING DOWN PROBLEM (do each step first before moving onto other):
- build grid
- allow grid to make start node
- allow grid to make end node 
- ensure start node and end node are different colours
- allow 'walls'
- allow nodes to 'find' each other, using Dijikstra's Algorithm




To create a Node, we will make a node class so our model will follow OOP

NODE CLASS

INITIALISERS:
- white colour



METHODS:
- start node colour
- end node colour
- wall node colour
