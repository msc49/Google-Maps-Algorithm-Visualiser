- This file is just meant to be used as a guide for myself to plan this project
- it will be left in my repository just in case others wanted to have a look as it :)

before even trying to implement the algorithm, we need a grid:
- This can be made using HTML/CSS or Pygame. Although Pygame would be a better user experience, i will do it in the former to brush up on my HTML/CSS skills

The grid dimensions are irrelevant for now. The grid must be able to:
- Create a starting node
- Create an ending node
- (we will also add walls where the algorithm is not allowed to touch but for noe we ignore this)

To create a Node, we will make a node class so our model will follow OOP
