# Google Maps Algorithm Visualiser



## About The Project

For years, everytime i drive and use Google Maps, i wondered what algorithm they used to find the shortest distance. Last week, I decided to actually google the answer and came across an answer that it may potentially be Dijkstra's Algorithm.

I then decided to carry out a fun project where I would help 'visualise' this algorithm and how it calculates the shortest path possible. The project took around a week and during the first day, I did no coding at all. I decided to break the project down to as many small tasks as possible whilst also learning how the algorithm works. I broke down my tasks in the planning.md file which will also be included in this repository.

Learning the algorithm was not difficult at all but translating that to code took a while but it was worth the learning process. I also learnt about other data types that Python has such as deque as well as a library called Pygame.







<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

to get started please make sure have Python 3.9.10 installed on your local machine

- clone this repository to your local machine then cd into the respective directory
- ensure you have pygame installed. If you do not, run the following command in your terminal:

```
> python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user

```

- now run the following command in your terminal to visualise the algorithm:

```
> python3 main.py

```

## Commands for the algorithm

- left click once to select the start node
- left click again to select the end node
- click and hold to create any barriers

Now when you want the algorithm to run, press the SPACE BAR


## Screenshots

I have added images below to show how the algorithm works
